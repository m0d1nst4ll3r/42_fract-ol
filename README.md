# 42_fract-ol

(started 16/12/2021)

Todo-list:

- Implement auto-incrementing iterations
	- Nothing to be done, no single solution is gonna be one size fits all. So, what I'm gonna do is try a value, and if it looks off somewhere, increase it. Look at the seahorse valley to know where it might look off. Settle for a value that doesn't go too high either.
	- Seahorse valley can be extreme : 18k iterations for e-13
	- Minibrots are forgiving : 8.5k for e-11
	- Extreme minibrots (to the left) need almost nothing : 800 for e-13
- DONE ===> Implement color smoothing with an option to turn off
	- No option to turn off yet, have to add that
	- As a bonus, implement an option to change zoom strength mid-program
- Add mandel3, mandel4 and also maybe more (it rhymes) (zn+1 = znÂ³ + c etc)
- Implement anti-aliasing with an option to turn off
Last, details... code readability, comments...

Cut content:

- Test several configurations to optimize rendering time... mults instead of adds in complex loops... less variables... and try to optimize code where possible
Reason : no time and multithreading already more than made up for optimization problems
- Implement a way to time how long last frame took to render
Reason : not enough payoff, need to finish this quick
- Moving by holding RMB
Reason : I can call a function when RMB is pressed down and released and when the cursor moves while RMB is held, but how do I make a function get called when RMB is pressed down and wait for RMB releasing? Since idk how and it'll take too much time to figure out, this is cut.
- Drawing a rectangle by holding LMB
Reason : same as above plus the fact that there is no transparency in mlx so it'd be super hard to draw the outlines of a moving rectangle. Too much effort.
- Multiple windows
Reason : too hard to make at this point, should've structured my program around it from the start
- A way to save locations and load them up so when you find something cool you can get back to it quickly
Reason : came up with this already really late in the project and I just wanna be done with it, but this is actually pretty doable (have to write to a file and parse it though...)
