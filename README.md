# 42_fract-ol

Just started!

Todo:
- Understand how to use mlx
	- https://elearning.intra.42.fr/notions/minilibx/subnotions/mlx-introduction/videos/introduction-to-minilibx
	- https://elearning.intra.42.fr/notions/minilibx/subnotions/mlx-events/videos/minilibx-events
	- https://elearning.intra.42.fr/notions/fdf/subnotions/introduction-to-fdf/videos/introduction-to-fdf
	- https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx
- Understand how fractals work
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set

My understanding of the goals:
- Your program should display an image of a fractal, with which you can interact with
- Available fractals should at least contain the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set (more would be awesome)
- The use of color is crucial to make the fractals visible and pretty and this is up to you
- The mouse wheel should allow the user to zoom in, bonus points if it zooms in based on cursor positions, more bonus points if you can explore around with directional keys
- A parameter will be passed through command line to select fractal type (maybe more, too, like color set or whatever), in the absence of any command, commands should be listed and the program should exit properly
- For at least the Julia set you should be able to create different Julia sets with parameters
- ESC will exit
- More fractals for bonus points (also it's awesome)
- Making colors shift during execution for a psychedelic effect

Unclear :
- The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended >> what's that and why
- How the hell I'm gonna do this
